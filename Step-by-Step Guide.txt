Step-by-Step Guide
Backup Databases:

Backup all SSAS databases and verify that they can be restored. This includes system databases (master, msdb, etc.) and user databases.

Create a backup of SSAS configurations and settings.

Run Setup:

Launch the SQL Server Installation Wizard (Setup.exe) from your SQL Server 2019 installation media.

Select Upgrade: Choose the option to upgrade from a previous version of SQL Server.

Specify Instance Name:

Enter the name of the existing SSAS instance you want to upgrade.

Configure Service Accounts:

Specify the service accounts for the new instance. If you're using default service accounts, note that the new service may run under a different account2.

Complete Installation:

Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

Review and accept the license terms and configure the instance as needed.

Post-Upgrade Tasks:

Check Database Integrity: Run DBCC commands to check the integrity of your databases.

Test Reports and Dashboards: Verify that reports, spreadsheets, and dashboards are functioning correctly.

Test Processing Operations: Ensure that processing operations are working as expected.
how to Test Processing Operations
Testing processing operations in SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) involves verifying that your data is correctly processed and that your reports and queries return accurate results. Here are the steps to test processing operations:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

Connect to your SSAS instance.

Select the Object to Process:

Right-click the object you want to process (e.g., database, cube, dimension, measure group, mining model, or mining structure).

Choose Process from the context menu.

Choose Processing Options:

In the Process dialog box, select the appropriate processing option. Options include:

Process Default: Processes objects that are unprocessed or partially processed.

Process Full: Re-processes the entire object, dropping and reloading all data.

Process Clear: Drops all data without reloading.

Process Data: Processes only the data without building aggregations or indexes.

Process Add: Adds new data without reprocessing existing data.

Run Impact Analysis:

Click Impact Analysis to identify and optionally process dependent objects that will be affected.

Monitor Processing:

Use SQL Server Profiler to monitor the processing operations and identify any issues or performance bottlenecks.

Verify Results:

After processing, verify that the data is correctly loaded and that your reports and queries return accurate results.

Check for any errors or warnings in the processing logs.

Test in Production:

Perform the same processing operations in your production environment to ensure everything works as expected.





Adjust Scripts: Update any scripts or connection strings to use the new server name.

Test Backup and Restore: Perform backup and restore operations to ensure they work with the new setup.

Additional Considerations
Compatibility Levels: Ensure that the compatibility levels of your databases are appropriate for SQL Server 2019.

Performance Testing: Compare performance metrics before and after the upgrade to ensure there are no regressions.

Documentation: Document the entire process and any changes made during the upgrade.
