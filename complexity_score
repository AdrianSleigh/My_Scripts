    Script: Database Query Complexity Trend Analysis

    Description:
    This script analyzes query performance metrics across all databases and assigns a complexity score based on five key indicators:
    - Average CPU time per query
    - Average duration per query
    - Average logical reads per query
    - Average query text length
    - Average estimated plan cost

    Each metric is normalized into a score between 0.2 and 1.0 based on predefined thresholds.
    The total raw score is the sum of these five normalized values, ranging from 1.0 to 5.0.

    Complexity Score Mapping:
    - Raw score ≤ 1.49 → Complexity Score = 1 (Very Low)
    - Raw score 1.50–2.49 → Complexity Score = 2 (Low)
    - Raw score 2.50–3.49 → Complexity Score = 3 (Moderate)
    - Raw score 3.50–4.49 → Complexity Score = 4 (High)
    - Raw score ≥ 4.50 → Complexity Score = 5 (Very High)

    Notes:
    - NULL values in query plan cost or other metrics are handled using COALESCE to avoid aggregation warnings.
    - The script uses dynamic management views to extract query statistics and plan cost estimates.
